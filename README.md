## Downloading Virus Names
Virus files and names downloading from "https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Viruses/" and all of them are .gbk (Genbank) files.
When the user select one virus and click "Select and Download Virus Genbank" buttons Python will download Genkbank files from given website.

## Check Virus Features
If the user select one virus and click a button which "Check Virus Features" user will reach this informations:

Also user can see  gene sequence and user can copy gene sequences line by line.:

## Check Chromosomes
If user click "Check Chromosomes" in the main screen user can see selected viruses chromosomes. User can use scrool to move down, up, right, left.

## Check Gene Diagram
If user click "Check Gene Diagram" button in the main screen, user can see selected viruses gene diagrams. User can use scrool to move down, up, right, left.

## Show Chromosomes Inside
If user click "Show Chromosmes Inside" button in the main screen, user can see selected viruses chromosomes inside. User can use scrool to move down, up, right, left.

## Comparing Viruses
User can compare viruses features which are taxonomy, pathology etc..

## Usage
Open the Software and select which virus do you want to see what contains what inside in selected virus.
If the user close the program and re-run it again because of the database system, user don't have to collect viruses links again . Besides that, user don't have to install viruses genkbank files again.
